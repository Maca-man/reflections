When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have work that you want to share with the public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are working with others on the same project and others push
    branches to github and you automatically pull those commits you may 
    be pulling changes that are not wanted

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks clone repositories from git hub into git hub.
    clone copies repostory into a local repository
    branches are what is copied pushed or pulled when using 
    fork or clone

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    By having the last known state saved locally you can run git fetch
    git fetch will pull changes made on the cloud and add them from to 
    branch from the point in origin. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe google docs but everything seems easier with git now

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when you want to add a change and share the change but not update the master
    branch in github
